### Event 1 : 2020 Siberia Heatwave

From Fig.2 it can be indicated that there was a minor warming trend from 4 June to 8 June in the Эвено-Бытантайский Национальный улус region(67.5N, 130E), followed by a sudden drop in temperature. Starting from 10 June, temperatures began to rise continuously, reaching a peak of 28.14°C on 21 June and remaining in a high-temperature state until the end of the month.

To better understand whether there were indeed unusual temperature changes in June 2020 compared to previous years, Fig.3 shows the historical temperature range for this location from 1979 to June 2020, with the upper and lower bounds corresponding to the 90th and 10th quantiles, respectively. It can be observed that the slight warming from 4 June to 8 June generally remained within the 90th percentile range. However, during 19 June to 30 June, temperatures exceeded the 90th quantile line almost every day, indicating the occurrence and the length of a heatwave during that period. What is worth noted is that there was an unusual drop in temperature on 10 June, conveniently situated between the two warming events.

Fig.4 shows the distribution of the maximum temperature on June 21 from 1979 to 2020. The dashed red line represents the maximum temperature in 2020 -- it is apparent that the temperature in the past has never exceeded it.

Since there are only 44 samples in Fig.4, I want to increse the samples by using data plus or minus three days from 21 June(which are, 18 to 24 June). Fig.5 shows the distribution of the maximum temperature on June 21+/- 3days from 1979 to 2020. The dashed red line represents the maximum temperature in 2020. It shows that the record on 21 June, 2020 is still the highest compared to the rest. In other words, the temperature record on 21 June, 2020 is the highest in the past 42 years, which shows the intensity of this heatwave event.

### Event 2 : 2021 Western North America Heatwave -- Lytton Wildfire

Fig.7 shows the temperature variation from June 2021 to July 2021 at Lytton (50N, 120W), represented by the daily maximum near-surface temperature. From this plot we can see there was an unsual surge in temperature from 24 June to 1 July. The red dashed line marked the date on which the wildfire happened, 30 June, which is also the date that had the highest maximum temperature, 37.6°C.

Fig.8 shows the temperature variation from June 2021 to July 2021 compared to 1979–2021 climatology, with the upper and lower bounds corresponding to the 90th and 10th quantiles, respectively. There was a period of extremely high tempeature from 26 June to 31 June, almost twice the interval from 10th to 90th quantile, and within it the wildfire occured. There were also several relatively "small" heatwave events(e.g. on day 21-23 and 43-45 since 31 May) before and after the wildfire.

Fig.10 illustrates the distribution of the maximum temperature on June 30 from 1979 to 2020. There are 44 samples totally. The dashed red line represents the maximum temperature in 2021 -- it can be indicated that the temperature of the same day in the past has never exceeded it. Furthermore, it is located on the far right end of the chart, keeping a distance from the other samples, indicating it is an extremely rare case.

Fig.11 shows the distribution of the maximum temperature from an wider day range -- 27 June to 2 July from 1979 to 2022. The dashed red line represents the maximum temperature in 2021. It shows a similar result as Fig.10 -- that the extremely high temperature on 31, June, 2021 is the highest of this time period in the history. With this fact, we can indicate that the wildfire happened in Lytton is prababily facilitated by this unprecedented high temperature.
